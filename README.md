I am a civil engineering student .I have a good background in java but i am facing a problem in solving these tasks .I am trying my best .I did my best to do this exercise but not fully successful due to the fact that i never used the android studio before.I am facing so many errors in my project.Any help would be appreciated because i really want to do this course.
